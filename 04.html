            <h2>Florence + The Machine - Kiss With A Fist</h2>
            <p>You hit me once, I hit you back
                You gave a kick, I gave a slap
                You smashed a plate over my head
                Then I set fire to our bed
                You hit me once, I hit you back
                You gave a kick, I gave a slap
                You smashed a plate over my head
                Then I set fire to our bed, oh
                My black eye casts no shadow
                Your red eye sees nothing
                Your slaps don't stick, your kicks don't hit
                So we remain the same
                Love sticks, sweat drips
                Break the lock if it don't fit
                A kick to the teeth is good for some
                A kiss with a fist is better than none
                Oh, a kiss with a fist is better than none
                I broke your jaw once before
                I spilled your blood upon the floor
                You broke my leg in return
                So sit back and watch the bed burn
                Love sticks, sweat drips
                Break the lock if it don't fit
                A kick in the teeth is good for some
                A kiss with a fist is better than none
                Oh, kiss with a fist is better than none
                You hit me once, I hit you back
                You gave a kick, I gave a slap
                You smashed a plate over my head
                Then I set fire to our bed, oh
                Oh, you hit me once, I hit you back
                You gave a kick, I gave a slap
                You smashed a plate over my head
                Then I set fire to our bed</p>
